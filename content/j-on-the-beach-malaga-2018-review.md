[J On The Beach](https://jonthebeach.com) (JOTB) is *"A Big Data
Conference On The Beach"* happening in Malaga (Spain) and this year (2018)
was its third edition.

# tl;dr

* The staff was great, the speakers awesome and the talks interesting.  

* I felt very comfortable and almost at home during the three days. The
atmosphere felt like being at a local conference or meetup but with famous and
renowned speakers from around the world.  

* Everyone I met - speakers/attendees/staff - was accessible and affable.  

* YES, I did copy/paste the three points above from
  [last year's review](../j-on-the-beach-malaga-2017-review), and NO, I'm
  not ashamed of copy/pasting things.

* Less great than last year, no diner included, "just" breakfast and lunch so
  I had to eat outside, like in tapas bars or restaurants by the beach...

* Great line-up with diversity in mind, kudos {{< emoji content=":thumbsup:" >}}

* Met a few people from last year and a few new people, awesome!

* Unfortunately I couldn't attend the party but I'm sure it was as great as last
  year's.

# Preamble

I wasn't sure I would attend JOTB 2018 because I had more or less decided to
attend only one big conference this year, like [Strange Loop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/)
or the [Clojure/conj](http://clojure-conj.org/).  
And then I saw [the speakers](https://jonthebeach.com/speakers) announcements
on Twitter, one after the other, and couldn't resist.  
So here's my review of J On The Beach 2018!

<small>Hopefully shorter than last year's</small>

* The title of the conference *"A Big Data Conference On The Beach"* is still not a
scam: the beach is right there, 200 meters away from the conference venue
[La Termica](http://www.latermicamalaga.com/).

* The location was easy to find because it is a cultural center. It is not in
the city center, more halfway between the airport and the center and can
be reached in 40 minutes walk by the beach. There are hotels around and a
bus stop 50m from the entrance, as well as city bikes spots.

* The place in itself is nice, the hallways and rooms are large and bright.

* The staff was really welcoming every days, everyone speaking English and
willing to assist the speakers and attendees.

* YES, I did copy/paste the four points above from
  [last year's review](../j-on-the-beach-malaga-2017-review), I mean, get
  used to it.

* Necklace with printed program schedule and plan just like in 2017, also the
  bracelet that I still don't like but hey ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

* The registration was sooo smooth. Compared to last year's, they've split the
  stream of incoming attendees into two groups by alphabetical order. Great
  improvement.

* I'll skip the goodies part for this year, they were OK: couple of notepads,
stickers, sunglasses, sunscreen ^^

# Conclusion

Much like the previous year, J On The Beach 2018 has been a really interesting
conference and joyful experience.

**Thanks a lot to the organizers, speakers and other attendees for the great
event.**

Who knows, I might even come back next year for the third time in a row ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

* Virtual handshake to [Rosa Castillo](https://twitter.com/rosacastilloPhD) and
  [Vlad Mihalcea](https://twitter.com/vlad_mihalcea) for the Hallway Track and
  fun time during the breaks.
* Also to [Andrei Dan](https://twitter.com/rocketarium) and
  [Max Novelli](https://jonthebeach.com/speakers/40/Max+Novelli), it was great
  to see you again after JOTB17, see you in 2019?
* Final thank you note to [MonkeyPatch](http://www.monkeypatch.io/) (the
  company I work for) for paying and allowing me to attend a conference in
  Malaga **once again**!
