      <description>The goal: something like that   Created: February 7th, 2019 Object: As I was preparing the next evening of the ToulouseJUG I found myself lacking a second mic for our next duet. This post is a note to myself about the setup for recording audio of one or two speakers with the pieces of equipment I have at my disposal, with pictures, so I can come back later and relearn how to do this.</description>
