<h2 id="a-simple-use-case">A simple use case</h2>

<p>One of the biggest pain points I had when I started to learn about concurrent programming, was the emphasis put on
<code>Blocking</code>, <code>Non-blocking</code>, <code>Synchronous</code> and <code>Asynchronous</code> code.<br />
We&rsquo;ll touch on all four of them in the next parts of this series.</p>

<p>After reading a lot I figured that implementing a simple use case would comfort my understandings and help me convey
what I wanted to explain. So here&rsquo;s a not totally made up, simple use case:</p>

<div class="gallery" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageGallery">

<div class="title">Use case: A proxy server</div>
</div>


<p>We want to offer access to some resource out of our domain to Web clients, but the resource is kind of &ldquo;precious&rdquo; so
we want to restrict its access. Clients will not have direct access to the data source but will pass through a proxying
service responsible to manage accesses.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>A client addresses a download request to the proxy service</li>
<li>The proxy service registers the request to a coordinator</li>
<li>The coordinator is responsible for the scheduling logic, managing some sort of priority queue for instance. Its logic
is irrelevant.</li>
<li>The coordinator responds either &ldquo;Unavailable&rdquo; or &ldquo;Available&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Unavailable&rdquo; means that the client can&rsquo;t download the resource just yet so the responses&rsquo; payload contains a token</li>
<li>The payload also contains an &ldquo;ETA&rdquo; so the service can decide to abort or to retry, using the token to keep its place
in the coordinator&rsquo;s queue</li>
<li>The payload also contains a &ldquo;wait&rdquo; time to rate-limit the retry requests to the coordinator</li>
<li>The proxy may have to retry a couple of times, on behalf of the client, but will eventually receive an &ldquo;Available&rdquo;
response</li>
<li>With an &ldquo;Available&rdquo; response and the token contained in its payload, the proxy service can initiate a download
request to the data source</li>
<li>The proxy service streams the content of the download request back to its client</li>
<li>While at the same time sending periodic &ldquo;heartbeat&rdquo; requests to the coordinator to ensure its token is not revoked</li>
</ol>

<p>We are going to use in the next parts of the series. We will implement this proxy service in
various ways, simulate  a few (200) clients connecting simultaneously and see the pros and cons of each implementation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bear in mind that this is not a benchmark, it&rsquo;s just an experiment.<br />
200 clients is a really low number but is enough to observe a few interesting things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="first-implementation">First implementation</h2>

<p>I am now going to show you the easiest way I came up with to implement this proxy service.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s first simulate a few clients:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">for(int i=0; i&lt;MAX_CLIENTS; i++) {
    elasticServiceExecutor.submit(() -&gt; {
        try {
            getThingy();
        } catch (EtaExceededException e) {
            err(&quot;Couldn't getThingy because ETA exceeded: &quot; + e);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            err(&quot;Couldn't getThingy because something failed: &quot; + e);
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this implementation, <code>elasticServiceExecutor</code> is a &ldquo;cached&rdquo; <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">elasticServiceExecutor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(new PrefixedThreadFactory(&quot;service&quot;));
</code></pre>

<p>I will explain why in a little bit.</p>

<p><code>getThingy()</code> is the download endpoint in this example. Each client &ldquo;connecting&rdquo; to the proxy hits this method.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">private void getThingy() throws EtaExceededException, IOException {
    println(&quot;Start getThingy.&quot;);

    try {
        Connection.Available conn = getConnection();
        println(&quot;Got token, &quot; + conn.getToken());

        Thread pulse = makePulse(conn);
        try (InputStream content = gateway.downloadThingy()) {
            pulse.start();

            ignoreContent(content);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            err(&quot;Download failed.&quot;);
            throw e;
        }
        finally {
            pulse.interrupt();
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // D'oh!
        err(&quot;Task interrupted.&quot;);
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
    println(&quot;Download finished&quot;)
}
</code></pre>

<p>First we retrieve an &ldquo;Available&rdquo; connection <code>conn</code> from the coordinator, then we initiate the download request to the
data source (called <code>gateway</code> in this example, just to make it confusing&hellip;).<br />
Once the download has begun we start the heartbeat requests while consuming the content (here we simply drop it, but in
a real scenario we would forward to the client).<br />
Once the download ends (successfully or not) we stop sending heartbeat requests and the call ends.</p>

<p>There are a few things to unpack, but the least interesting first, <code>makePulse</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">private Thread makePulse(Connection.Available conn) {
    return new Thread(() -&gt; {
        while(!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
            try {
                // Periodic heartbeat
                Thread.sleep(2_000L);

                println(&quot;Pulse!&quot;);
                coordinator.heartbeat(conn.getToken());
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // D'oh!
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing fancy here, we sleep for a while, then send a request, sleep for a while, &hellip;</p>

<p>You may have noticed that <code>getThingy</code> uses the <code>gateway</code> service to talk to the data source and that <code>makePulse</code> uses
the <code>coordinator</code> service to talk to the coordinator. So what is this <code>getConnection</code> method and why does <code>getThingy</code>
not use <code>coordinator</code> directly?</p>

<p>The reason is the retry logic than we&rsquo;ve talked about before. <code>getConnection</code> is actually a helper to handle
the &ldquo;Unavailable&rdquo; responses from the coordinator and only return when an <code>Available</code> response has been received. Here&rsquo;s
the code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">private Connection.Available getConnection() throws EtaExceededException, InterruptedException {
    return getConnection(0, 0, null);
}

private Connection.Available getConnection(long eta, long wait, String token) throws EtaExceededException, InterruptedException {
    for(;;) {
        if (eta &gt; MAX_ETA_MS) {
            throw new EtaExceededException();
        }

        if (wait &gt; 0) {
            Thread.sleep(wait);
        }

        println(&quot;Retrying download after &quot; + wait + &quot;ms wait.&quot;);

        Connection c = coordinator.requestConnection(token);
        if (c instanceof Connection.Available) {
            return (Connection.Available) c;
        }
        Connection.Unavailable unavail = (Connection.Unavailable) c;
        eta = unavail.getEta();
        wait = unavail.getWait();
        token = unavail.getToken();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We start with initial <code>eta</code> and <code>wait</code> times at zero and no token (<code>null</code>).<br />
Then we try to get a grant from the coordinator.<br />
If the coordinator rejects us with an <code>Unavailable</code> response, we update the eta, wait and token and loop, otherwise we
can return the <code>Available</code> response.</p>

<p>As I said: <strong>the easiest implementation I came up with</strong>.</p>

<p>This code is not perfect, but it has this one particularly interesting property: any Java developer at any level from
junior to expert can understand what this does!<br />
It is classic, old, boring, imperative Java code which does the job.</p>

<p>And <em>easy</em> is important, right?</p>

<h2 id="profiling">Profiling</h2>

<h2 id="context-switches">Context switches</h2>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>On the JVM, the threads we manipulate are actually kernel threads (TODO: rework, in my presentations I used to mention the kernel
threads when talking about the CachedThreadPoolExecutor, maybe this is right here and should be a remainider aka &ldquo;*&rdquo;
when talking about the code later.).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pausing&rdquo; (TODO: make sure of the terms for suspending a thread and their states (ready, runnable, etc.)) a thread from
the kernel&rsquo;s point of view is a task requiring to get out of user-mode (TODO talk about rings?) into privileged mode
to execute reserved instructions in order to save the execution state of the thread, schedule another one, load its
state and go back to user mode (TODO: maybe introduce &ldquo;wankel&rdquo; diagrams here).<br />
This is also known as context switching and is detrimental to performance (TODO add link, see pocket) because the cycles
spent on &ldquo;book keeping&rdquo; are not spent running your tasks.</p>

<h2 id="two-types-of-code">Two types of code</h2>

<p>In this part</p>

<p>Today, in our tool belts, we have processors much (much!) more powerful than in the sixties or seventies. We have
<strong>multiprocessor</strong> computers and even <strong>multi-core</strong> processors. What do we have on the software side?</p>

<p>When the scheduler time-slices a long-running thread there&rsquo;s not much we can do about it (TODO: open to unikernels?).
But we can maximize efficiency by being careful to avoid blocking calls and use async APIs.</p>

<p>[TODO] if this wasn&rsquo;t too obvious at this point, here I really get back in track with my recent presentation at the
moment where I introduce async programming. In the talk a talk just a bit more about how sync is great while here I
don&rsquo;t talk about programming styles/APIs at all, this must be fixed.</p>

<p>The thing with async APIs is that it&rsquo;s not obvious to differentiate async from non-blocking, and vice-versa.<br />
An asynchronous call can still be thread-blocking. (TODO: yes, this should be illustrated with content from my talks).
It may of may not block the current thread but run the distinct control stack on another thread, managed in a library
specific thread pool.</p>

<p>So asynchronous thread blocking APIs are nice because they&rsquo;re blocking other threads, but the problem of memory
footprint of kernel threads and context switches still remains.</p>

<p>Truly non-blocking asynchronous APIs rely on event loops and fine tuned implementation techniques such as work
stealing and drain loops in order to maximize CPU utilisation.<br />
But they rely on callbacks too, which leads to the infamous callback-hell that.</p>

<p>TODO: Yup, rework this part, heavily.</p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re in 2019 so we have libraries now to lift this problem off of our shoulders, namely Reactive Streams libraries
such as RxJava or Pivotal&rsquo;s Project Reactor.</p>

<p>Reactive Streams APIs are a great solution to the inefficient use of CPU but they come as a whole new programming style.
A new paradigm on a platform that may not be suited for it.</p>

<p>And becauseit&rsquo;s 2019, we&rsquo;re stating to get feedback on these libraries, hinting they&rsquo;re not the best for all use-cases,
most notably because of debugging and profiling and interoperability with existing (blocking) code.</p>

<p>Even after almost two years I sometimes have to think hard about which Reactor operator to use, am I messing up
ordering, am I blocking here, am I lazy there, am I stack safe?</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to ask, is there another way? Can we write non-blocking, efficient code without Reactive Streams
APIs while still avoiding async APIs and callback hell?<br />
Project Loom is one possible answer.</p>

<p>Again, you can see this scheduling story has been running for quite some time now. (TODO link to beginning, possible
distinct article).</p>

<p>TODO: Note: unrelated to this specific location: synchronized -&gt; doog lea -&gt; reactive -&gt; loom</p>

<p>The lightweight concurrency mechanisms that Loom aims to bring to the JVM are also known as user-threads.<br />
TODO: Checkboxes again.</p>

<p>Contrary to Kernel threads, which are managed by the kernel, user threads are manager by the language or runtime and
are named this way because they un in user space.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see why they&rsquo;re interesting and how they work, but I think it&rsquo;s time to check a few boxes now:</p>

<ul>
<li>lightweight threads</li>
<li>user threads</li>
<li>fibers</li>
<li>coroutnies</li>
<li>erlang processes</li>
<li>goroutines</li>
<li>async/await
are all, basically, user thread mechanisms and they differ in their implementation details or whether they&rsquo;re
first-class citizens or language syntax.</li>
</ul>

<p>All those details matter from a language implementer&rsquo;s point of view and are really interesting, but if you&rsquo;re not that
much of a language geek, hopefully I can save you some research time with this statement.</p>

<p>The only bow I&rsquo;m not goiing to tick here is green-threads because they have a specific meaning in the Java world, so
I&rsquo;m leaving this as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>Bak to user-threads.<br />
The conceptual model for user-threads is often referred to in the literature (TODO link) as the M:N model, where M
represents the number of user-threads running on top of N kernel threads.</p>

<p>Just to give a little bit more details, we can add the letter P in M:N:P to explicit the fact that M user-threads run
on N kernel threads on top of P processor cores. Where N would be as close to P as possible, ideally.</p>

<p>In Project Loom, user-threads are called lightweight/virtual threads, so I&rsquo;ll stick with this name from now on.</p>

<p>The reason why fibers are interesting is because the cost of creating, suspending and resuming those fibers is
massively reduced by the scheduler running in user-space, which means no extra kernel/user mode context-switches.</p>

<p>How does it work&hellip;<br />
Implementations vary: Kotlin transforms suspendable functions bytecode during compilation, Clojure transforms code at
macro-expansion time, etc.</p>

<p>It turns out that Java in particular, and Kotlin too actually, even before it had coroutines, Fibers have exsited for
quite some time. Since 2013 at least, thanks to a library named [Quasar].</p>

<p>Quasar has been developed by a company named [Parallel Universe][puniverse] who, sadly, no longer exists, but whose
CTO and core developer is now Project Loom&rsquo;s lead developer: Ron Pressler.<br />
Quasar implements fibers by instrumenting the Java bytecode and scans methods annotated as &ldquo;suspendable&rdquo; and turns them
into continuations that run on a Fiber scheduler. Those continuations have the ability to <code>yield</code>, or relinquish the
thread they are currently running on when encountering a blocking call.</p>

<p>On my last project, we implemented a service whose responsibility was to proxy requests to remote backends through
a limited number of connections. The goal of this scheduler was to maximize the use of connections, or in other words,
minimize the time during which a given connection would sit idle, unused.<br />
I&rsquo;m not ashamed to say that even after almost two years of using Reactor daily, I didn&rsquo;t feel the nerves to do it with
a Reactive Streams implementation.</p>

<p>My colleague Guillaume started the Spring Boot 2 project, implemented the first REST endpoints and other background
tasks necessary for the service, but when it was my turn to implement the logic of the scheduler and states and
transitions, I went for Quasar and fiber-blocking, imperative code, and an actor model, but it&rsquo;s another story.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Reactor wasn&rsquo;t a good fit for this problem or that it couldn&rsquo;t be done. In fact I&rsquo;m sure it could be,
just not by me, and I still think it was a good idea to find another way.</p>

<p>So when you&rsquo;ve followed the work of Ron Pressler, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the way he proposed to approach implementing
Fibers on the JVM is through the use of continuations.<br />
Now, what&rsquo;s a continuation?</p>

<p>Conceptually, a continuation represents the rest of the execution of a process from a certain point in time.<br />
More practically, when looking at the following code:</p>

<p>TODO: insert code sample with &ldquo;suspension point&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Who&rsquo;s  already heard about continuations?<br />
Most programming languages today do not expose continuations and ways to create them as first-class citizens. Pretty
much like many languages did not expose functions as first-class until the resurgence of functional programming.<br />
Continuations are very fundamental and extremely powerful, and after preparing this talk I now find them more interesting
by themselves then their use in the context of fibers. But anyways.</p>

<p>The way continuations allow fibers implementation is via the yielding mechanism.<br />
As soon as a running continuation encounters a blocking call, it calls this yield instruction.</p>

<p>The runtime will then know that this continuation&rsquo;s stack can be saved, put aside for when its execution can be
restarted, and will pick another continuation, which is ready to be restarted, if any, restore its control stack and
assign it to the CPU.</p>

<p>So Fibers in Loom are the association of continuations, and a scheduler.</p>
