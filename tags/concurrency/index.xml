      <description>Part 3 in a series of articles about Project Loom.
In this part we re-implement our proxy service with an asynchronous API.

   Atelier de couture  J. Trayer 1854 CC0 1.0    We&amp;rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground in the previous entries and we&amp;rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that blocking code &amp;ldquo;is bad&amp;rdquo; Â©.</description>

      <description>Part 2 in a series of articles about Project Loom.
In this part we implement a proxy service, the easiest way possible.

   Weaving  Max Pixel CC0 1.0    A simple use case One of the biggest pain points I had when I started to learn about concurrent programming, was the emphasis put on Blocking, Non-blocking, Synchronous and Asynchronous code.</description>

      <description>Part 1 in a series of articles about Project Loom.
In this part we skim the surface of scheduling history before diving into the JVM.

   Jacquard Loom  Stephencdickson CC BY-SA 4.0    There&amp;rsquo;s only one hard problem The first problem there is with concurrency (and generally in computer science/programming really), is that we&amp;rsquo;re extremely bad at naming things.</description>

      <description>Part 0 in a series of articles about Project Loom.
In this part I just talk about me, me, me, me and why I wrote this.

 Finding good introduction level articles on parallel or concurrent programming is not easy because every post assumes some prior knowledge. You can quickly find yourself into dark corners of the Web where people talk about lock-free concurrency while you&amp;rsquo;re absolutely not ready for this!</description>

      <description>When the scheduler time-slices a long-running thread there&amp;rsquo;s not much we can do about it (TODO: open to unikernels?). But we can maximize efficiency by being careful to avoid blocking calls and use async APIs.
[TODO] if this wasn&amp;rsquo;t too obvious at this point, here I really get back in track with my recent presentation at the moment where I introduce async programming. In the talk a talk just a bit more about how sync is great while here I don&amp;rsquo;t talk about programming styles/APIs at all, this must be fixed.</description>
