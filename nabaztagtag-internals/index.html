<li><strong>Updated</strong>: June 15th, 2016</li>
<li><strong>Created</strong>: June 6th, 2016</li>
<li><strong>Object</strong>: Detail what&rsquo;s inside a Nabaztag/tag, with components references when possible.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m obviously not the first one trying to recycle my Nabaztag. Previous dissections have been done by others so I will reuse what they have done and will keep it here as a reference for my own usage.</p>

<p>Most of the information on this page come from <a href="http://petertyser.com/nabaztag-nabaztagtag-dissection/">this guy</a>, so <em>thank you</em>.</p>

<p>Pictures are from multiple sources (links at the bottom of this page) and I&rsquo;ve made my own, mostly because I didn&rsquo;t find pictures detailing the ears mechanism (DC motors, pulleys-belt and IR encoders).</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice my Nabaztag/tag&rsquo;s plastic body turned a bit yellowish with the years, I&rsquo;ll try to fix this with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retr0bright">Retr0bright chemical mixture</a> later on.</p>

<h2 id="front-view">Front view</h2>


<figure  >

            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<p>So from this point of view we can see (top/down):</p>

<ul>
<li>A button at the top;</li>
<li>Two rotating, magnetic placeholders for the ears;</li>
<li>4 LEDs with directional cones;</li>
<li>An RFID reader at the center, in front of the main board;</li>
<li>A microphone at the base of the rabbit;</li>
<li>The main board but I don&rsquo;t care about this one.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="back-view">Back view</h2>

        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/2-Back-view.jpg" alt="Picture of Nabaztag/tag back view"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>




<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/6-Inside-back.jpg" alt="Picture of Nabaztag/tag opened back view"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<p>At the rear, we can see (top/down):</p>

<ul>
<li>Two IR encoders to control the rotation of the ears, at the top;</li>
<li>The WiFi antenna at the center, in green;</li>
<li>A loudspeaker a the center just under the WiFi antenna;</li>
<li>The small card at the bottom is the &ldquo;power adapter&rdquo;;</li>
<li>A scroll wheel;</li>
<li>A 3.5mm phone connector (headphone jack).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-button">The button</h2>

<p>Will be reusable as is, it seems, so I don&rsquo;t have much to say about this one.</p>

<h2 id="the-ears">The ears</h2>

<p>They are attached to the body via magnets and are really just two pieces of white plastic.</p>


<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/4-No-ears.jpg" alt="Picture of Nabaztag/tag without its ears"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<p>At some point, Violet or one of its successor, used to sell colored ears (with patterns and all) for fun and profit. I wonder where they did all go. Anyway.</p>


<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/9-Ears-motors.jpg" alt="Picture of Nabaztag/tag&#39;s ears mechanism"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<p>This is the internal view of the back of the rabbit once you&rsquo;ve removed the black plastic case covering the ears mechanism.</p>

<p>You can see it consists of two &ldquo;classic DC motors&rdquo;, wired to the rotating pads of the ears (on top) via pulleys-belts.</p>

<h3 id="the-dc-motors">The DC motors</h3>


<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/12-DC-motor.jpg" alt="Picture of Nabaztag/tag&#39;s ears DC motors"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<p>Plagiarizing <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Hack-the-Nabaztag/?ALLSTEPS">Hack the Nabaztag</a>, here&rsquo;s a description of the DC motors:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The motor wires are BROWN and RED. If you connect one to GND and one to
PWR, the ears will spin in one direction; if you swap them, they go in
the opposite direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want the ears to be bidirectional, you will have to implement an
H-bridge - a hardware switch that reverses a motor&rsquo;s polarity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks, this is exactly what we&rsquo;ll do eventually.</p>

<h3 id="the-ir-encoders">The IR encoders</h3>

<p>
<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/10-IR-encoder.jpg" alt="Picture of Nabaztag/tag&#39;s ears IR encoder"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/11-Pulleys-belt.jpg" alt="Picture of Nabaztag/tag&#39;s pulleys-belt and cogs mechanism"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>

</p>

<p>This time plagiarizing from <a href="https://github.com/Oripy/Rabbity-Pi/wiki/Nabaztag-hardware-investigation">Rabbity-Pi</a>, here&rsquo;s a description of the use of the IR encoder:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A IR encoder is used to control the rotation, a wheel with 20 tooth
passes in front of the IR sensor. Actually 3 of those tooth are missing
(in order to detect the absolute position). The Nabaztag is doing a full
rotation of the ears when booting in order to initialise the positioning.</p>

<p>Numbering each teeth from 0 to 19, ear is vertical when teeth number 3 is
in front of the sensor, and horizontal when it is teeth number 13.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Hack-the-Nabaztag/?ALLSTEPS">Hack the Nabaztag</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each of the little blue chips has a small optical encoder on it: an IR
LED and a receiver that senses it. As the ear turns, a gear&rsquo;s teeth pass
between the LED and receiver, and turn it &lsquo;on&rsquo; and &lsquo;off&rsquo;. The gear is
missing one single tooth, so the encoder knows: when its signal does NOT
get interrupted by the gear&rsquo;s teeth, the ear is pointing forward. On
tooth 3, ears point up; on tooth 13, they are horizontal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m a total electronic beginner and if you too, I&rsquo;ve googled around and found this <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9d3d-gNii8">great video on How an Encoder Works</a>.</p>

<h2 id="leds">LEDs</h2>


<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/LEDs.png" alt="Picture of Nabaztag/tag&#39;s LEDs and cones"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<p>On this picture we can see four directional cones to lead the LEDs light onto the translucent case.</p>

<p>The LEDs are soldered onto the board, and what you cannot see on this picture (and I forgot to take another one, duh) is that there is a fifth LED at the bottom of the main board, whose cone is aimed toward the bottom of the rabbit, to give some sort of &ldquo;ambient light&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to start &ldquo;doing electronics&rdquo; by having to identify components and unsolder them, so I just won&rsquo;t reuse the LEDs and experiment with simpler ones.</p>

<h2 id="rfid">RFID</h2>


<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/RFID.png" alt="Picture of Nabaztag/tag&#39;s RFID reader"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<p>The RFID reader is also visible on the front picture, right at the center, between the LED cones and in front of the main board.</p>

<p><a href="http://petertyser.com/nabaztag-nabaztagtag-dissection/">Nabaztagtag (Nabaztag v2) Dissection</a> has more detailed information as he tried identify each component of the RFID reader. I am not going to use the RFID reader at first, and I can&rsquo;t decide which technology (RFID, NFC, Bluetooth Low Energy?) I will use eventually, so I won&rsquo;t try to reuse it either.</p>

<h2 id="microphone">Microphone</h2>


<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/Microphone.png" alt="Picture of Nabaztag/tag&#39;s Microphone"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>




<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/16-Microphone.jpg" alt="Detailed view of the microphone"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<p>I do not know if I will make use of the microphone &ldquo;as is&rdquo; yet. Maybe I will have to replace it, be it for compatibility reasons or sound quality.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/RabbitPi-the-Alexa-Enabled-IFTTT-Connected-Ear-Wig/?ALLSTEPS">RabbitPi</a>, MisterM has used a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/">Pi camera</a> in his project to put where the Nabaztag/tag&rsquo;s microphone and Karotz (Nabaztag V3) camera used to stand. And for the microphone, he used a webcam&rsquo;s microphone.</p>

<p>Although he hacked a Nabaztag V1 which does not have a microphone already, whereas my V2 has one, I have to admit that I&rsquo;m very tempted to do the same thing (with the Pi camera). Plus I will not have to drill a hole, maybe just make it larger.</p>

<h2 id="wifi">WiFi</h2>

<p>The WiFi capabilities is added via two components as it seems, a wireless module attached to the back of the main board, and a WiFi antenna at the rear of the rabbit.</p>

<p>
<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/Wireless.png" alt="Detailed view of the wireless module"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/WiFi-antenna.png" alt="Detailed view of the WiFi antenna"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>

</p>

<p>Again, at this point I think I am just not going to use this setup at find a standalone WiFi dongle that fits into the rabbit&rsquo;s body. There are some <a href="http://hackaday.com/2015/11/28/first-raspberry-pi-zero-hack-piggy-back-wifi/">funny hacks</a> out there, and also an <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1991736672/iot-hat-for-raspberry-pi-a-must-have-for-pi-zero/description">interesting project</a> to keep an eye on.</p>

<h2 id="loudspeaker">Loudspeaker</h2>


<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/6-Inside-back.jpg" alt="Picture of Nabaztag/tag&#39;s loudspeaker"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<p>The loudspeaker is clearly visible at the center of the rabbit&rsquo;s back. To me it looks like a basic sound speaker, nothing to be afraid of.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/RabbitPi-the-Alexa-Enabled-IFTTT-Connected-Ear-Wig/?ALLSTEPS">RabbitPi</a>, MisterM has used a phillips soundspeaker in place of the original one.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I understand why, plus it looks like it needs a battery instead of just being powered by the Nabaztag itself. But maybe I just missed an important information while reading his project.</p>

<h2 id="power">Power</h2>

<p>
<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/13-Power-adapter-back.jpg" alt="Detailed back view of the power supply"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/14-Power-adapter-front.jpg" alt="Detailed front view of the power supply"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>

</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit lost, here.</p>

<p>This is the power supply of the Nabaztag/tag, which comes with a cord that I have lost, I mean I think did. And even if I still have it, somewhere, I&rsquo;m not quite sure what to do about it because I&rsquo;m pretty sure this needs work to make the voltage and stuff in line with what the RaspberryPi needs/can sustain.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Oripy/Rabbity-Pi/wiki/Nabaztag-hardware-investigation">Rabbity-Pi</a> summarizes my thinking almost accurately:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At first I wasn&rsquo;t interested in re-using the Nabaztag power system but as
it provides a removable connector that may be easily connected to my
electronic board, I may reuse it. At least to power the motors, and maybe
the Raspberry-Pi itself if the voltage and other characteristics are
suitable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/RabbitPi-the-Alexa-Enabled-IFTTT-Connected-Ear-Wig/?ALLSTEPS">RabbitPi</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had planned to run the motors from a usb power bank so that I&rsquo;d only
need a single power plug, but this turned out not to have enough grunt,
it wouldn&rsquo;t even light up the &ldquo;Working&rdquo; led on the HAT. I decided instead
to use a DC power adaptor to run the HAT and ears, I conveniently had one
of those universal ones with interchangeable tips handy. What I didn&rsquo;t
have was a DC socket to connect the adaptor to the HAT. [&hellip;] I
remembered from the teardown that the Nabaztag&rsquo;s original power lead was
a standard DC plug - therefore I could just re-wire the original power
socket to the HAT - neat! In the end I also re-used the original Nabaztag
power supply, as it provided just the right amount of power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m too much of a beginner to know at first sight what I can/cannot do with a piece of electronics. My guts tell me that I can reuse this (and <strong><em>me wants to reuse this</em></strong>), but I will see what I can do with it when I&rsquo;ll really begin messing with eletronics and get my hands dirty on some basic techniques.</p>

<h2 id="sound">Sound</h2>


<figure  >
    
        <img src="/img/nabaztagtag-internals/15-Wheel-and-Jack.jpg" alt="Detailed front view of the volume wheel and jack entry"
            width="100%"
            />
    
    
</figure>



<h3 id="scroll-wheel">Scroll wheel</h3>

<p>I definitely want to keep this and use it for either sound volume control or other interaction.</p>

<p>Again according to <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Hack-the-Nabaztag/?ALLSTEPS">Hack the Nabaztag</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The scroll wheel is a potentiometer: it measures voltage, which changes
as we rub the &lsquo;wiper&rsquo; up and down. This is an analog input, which the
Teensy will convert into a number between 0 and 1023.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&rsquo;s talking about a a <code>Teensy</code> because it&rsquo;s the microcontroller he&rsquo;s using. I <em>think</em> my RaspberryPi also has one or two analog inputs (need to check), and I also think it is possible to add external ones in the mix, so no blocker here, just need to wire everything correctly.</p>

<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>

<p>The following are two parts of <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Hack-the-Nabaztag/?ALLSTEPS">Hack the Nabaztag</a> that I quote here for reference, I feel like they will prove useful.</p>

<p>This section is called &ldquo;<strong>Step 10: Wiring it up, for reals.</strong>&rdquo; and it summarizes some wiring order instructions and voltage information:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this point, if you&rsquo;ve been working on a breadboard, it&rsquo;s time to take
it all apart and re-solder it permanently. This is going to be a MESS of
wires, so pay close attention to where you route things - there&rsquo;s less
space in that rabbit than you think!</p>

<p>My recommendation: take your break-apart headers, and solder your wires
to them first, so that they are like breakaway extensions from the
existing wires. Do everything but the H-bridge; that&rsquo;s a special case.
Once you have extension wires on all 5 sets (head, scroll, LEDs, and two
ears), temporarily mount the H-bridge and the Teensy somewhere on your
cardboard block. Route wires as carefully as you can into their final
places, and solder them into the Teensy. Finally, connect all the H
bridge wires to the motors and the Teensy.</p>

<p>As a review, these are the pins, as I&rsquo;ve placed them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Head button 14 (digital input)</li>
<li>Scroll wheel 21 (analog input)</li>
<li>LEDs 2 (output)</li>
<li>Left motor enable 7 (output)</li>
<li>Left motor reverse 8 (output)</li>
<li>Left motor forward 9 (output)</li>
<li>Right motor enable 10 (output)</li>
<li>Right motor reverse 11 (output)</li>
<li>Right motor forward 12 (output)</li>
<li>Left encoder 18 (analog input) (with resistor &ndash;&gt; GND)</li>
<li>Right encoder 19 (analog input) (with resistor &ndash;&gt; GND)</li>
</ul>

<p>The power should be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Head: NONE</li>
<li>Scroll: 3.3V</li>
<li>LEDs: 5V</li>
<li>H-Bridge: 5V</li>
<li>Encoder BLUE wires (with resistors): 5V</li>
<li>Encoder YELLOW wires: 3.3V</li>
</ul>

<p>&hellip; and you should have 6 wires going to GND.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is called &ldquo;<strong>Step 11: Putting the Bunny back together.</strong>&rdquo;, and its name is pretty self explanatory:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once you have all the wires soldered and heat-shinked, it&rsquo;s time to wrap
up.</p>

<p>First, make sure you&rsquo;ve removed the existing power jack from the base of
the black column, then thread your USB micro cable through the white
base. If it doesn&rsquo;t fit, shave some plastic off the cord&rsquo;s head until it
does. Plug it into the Teensy, and you&rsquo;re set for powering and updating
your new Bunny.</p>

<p>Screw the black column back onto the white base. You don&rsquo;t need the black
ring around the base anymore (though you can put it back if you like).</p>

<p>Gently wiggle the white case over the electronics and back into place.
This might take a while. Just be patient - press wires out of the way,
shave off more cardboard, add tape where needed - until it all fits
again. It&rsquo;s important to get the alignment right, or the ears will get
stuck against the body. If you run into this problem, place a thin
washer-magnet between the ear and the socket to give the ear some extra
clearance.</p>

<p>Put the screws in, and you&rsquo;re done - at least, with this part.</p>
